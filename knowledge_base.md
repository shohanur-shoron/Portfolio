## **10. Project Documentation: AI-Powered Portfolio Chatbot**

This document provides a technical overview of the Django-based portfolio chatbot project. The system is designed to function as an interactive, AI-powered question-answering agent that responds to queries based on the knowledge contained within this document.

### **10.1 System Architecture & Core Technologies**

The project is built on a modern web and AI stack, leveraging a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to provide accurate and contextually relevant answers.

*   **Backend Framework:** **Django** serves as the core web framework, handling HTTP requests, managing the database, and orchestrating the overall application logic.
*   **AI & NLP Orchestration:** **LangChain** is used to structure the RAG pipeline, connecting the language model, the vector store, and the data processing steps.
*   **Language Model (LLM):** The system integrates with a powerful Large Language Model (e.g., from **Google Gemini** or **OpenAI**) to understand user queries and generate human-like responses.
*   **Vector Database:** **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)** is used to create and manage a high-speed vector index. The text from `knowledge_base.md` is converted into numerical vectors (embeddings) and stored in this index for efficient similarity searches.
*   **Frontend:** The user interface is a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript application, styled to resemble a command-line terminal, providing a unique and engaging user experience.

### **10.2 How It Works: The RAG Pipeline**

The chatbot operates through the following steps:

1.  **Indexing (One-time setup):**
    *   A management command (`create_index`) is run to process the `knowledge_base.md` file.
    *   The text is split into smaller, manageable chunks.
    *   Each chunk is converted into a numerical vector embedding using a sentence-transformer model.
    *   These vectors are stored in the `faiss_index/` directory, creating a searchable knowledge index.

2.  **User Interaction (Real-time):**
    *   A user sends a message through the terminal-style web interface.
    *   The frontend sends the query to the Django backend via an API endpoint (defined in `api/urls.py` and handled by `api/views.py`).
    *   The backend converts the user's query into a vector embedding.
    *   This query vector is used to perform a similarity search against the FAISS index, retrieving the most relevant text chunks from the `knowledge_base.md`.
    *   The retrieved text chunks (the "context") and the original user query are passed to the LLM.
    *   The LLM generates a response that directly answers the user's question based *only* on the provided context.
    *   The response is sent back to the frontend and displayed to the user.

### **10.3 Project Directory Structure**

*   `manage.py`: The Django command-line utility for administrative tasks.
*   `db.sqlite3`: The SQLite database file for storing application data (if any).
*   `knowledge_base.md`: The source of truth for the chatbot. All answers are derived from this file.
*   `faiss_index/`: Contains the pre-computed FAISS vector index and associated metadata.
*   **`Portfolio/`**: The main Django project directory.
    *   `settings.py`: Contains all project configurations, including database settings, installed apps, and middleware.
    *   `urls.py`: The root URL configuration for the project.
    *   `views.py`: Contains the main view for rendering the chat interface.
*   **`api/`**: The Django app responsible for the chatbot's API.
    *   `views.py`: Contains the core logic for handling API requests, executing the RAG pipeline, and returning the AI's response.
    *   `urls.py`: Defines the API endpoints (e.g., `/api/chat/`).
    *   `management/commands/create_index.py`: A custom Django management command to build the FAISS index from the knowledge base.
*   **`static/`**: Contains the frontend assets.
    *   `js/terminal_chat.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the chat logic, communication with the backend API, and updates the UI.
    *   `style/terminal_bass.css`: The CSS file for styling the terminal interface.
*   **`template/`**: Contains the main HTML file (`index.html`) for the chat interface.
*   **`env/`**: The Python virtual environment directory containing all project dependencies.
